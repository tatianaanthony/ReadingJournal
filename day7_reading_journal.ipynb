    "\n",
    "From a [Car Talk Puzzler](http://www.cartalk.com/content/puzzlers):\n",
    "\n",
    "What is the longest English word, that remains a valid English word, as you remove its letters one at a time?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, letters can be removed from either end, or the middle, but you canât rearrange any of the letters. Every time you drop a letter, you wind up with another English word. If you do that, youâre eventually going to wind up with one letter and that too is going to be an English wordâone thatâs found in the dictionary. I want to know whatâs the longest word and how many letters does it have?\n",
    "\n",
    "Iâm going to give you a little modest example: Sprite. Ok? You start off with sprite, you take a letter off, one from the interior of the word, take the r away, and weâre left with the word spite, then we take the e off the end, weâre left with spit, we take the s off, weâre left with pit, it, and I. \n",
    "\n",
    "Write a program to find all words that can be reduced in this way, and then find the longest one.\n",
    "\n",
    "This exercise is a little more challenging than most, so here are some suggestions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You might want to write a function that takes a word and computes a list of all the words that can be formed by removing one letter. These are the âchildrenâ of the word.\n",
    "- Recursively, a word is reducible if any of its children are reducible. As a base case, you can consider the empty string reducible.\n",
    "- The word list from [Chapter 9.1](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/thinkpython2010.html) Exercise 1 doesnât contain single letter words. So you might want to add âIâ, âaâ, and the empty string.\n",
    "- To improve the performance of your program, you might want to memoize the words that are known to be reducible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Allen's solution: http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/code/reducible.py."
